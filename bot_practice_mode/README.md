## Bot Practice Mode

This plugin aims to keeps players busy with a dynamic amount of bots when there are not enough real players on the server. If someone connects to the empty server and joins a team, a bot is spawned to the opposite team. If the player wins the round against the bot, another bot is added to the bot team. If the player loses a round, the amount of bots gets reduced by 1 (cannot go below 1). Also bots' difficulty is managed depending on the player's performance against the bots. Winning multiple rounds leads to an increased difficulty, whereas losing will reduce it.

It is possible for other players who join the server, after the practice mode has already enabled itself, to join the team with humans and fight against bots. However, if a player joins into the bots' team, then the practice mode gets disabled immediately (and bots kicked), since now there is at least 1 real human on both teams and the server can function normally.
