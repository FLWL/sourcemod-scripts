# sourcemod-scripts
Collection of scripts written by me for SourceMod, mainly CS:GO.

## CS:GO
* [**bot_practice_mode**](https://github.com/FLWL/sourcemod-scripts/tree/master/bot_practice_mode) - play against waves of bots if the server is empty.
* [**bots_no_knives**](https://github.com/FLWL/sourcemod-scripts/tree/master/bots_no_knives) - prevent bots and players from spawning with inconvenient items equipped.
* [**map_weapon_randomizer**](https://github.com/FLWL/sourcemod-scripts/tree/master/map_weapon_randomizer) - change out weapons in a map for random ones.
